  ## About
  Artoo is a micro-framework for robotics.
  It provides a simple, but powerful DSL (domain-specific language) for robots and physical computing.

:markdown
  ## Meet the DSL
  Artooâ€™s simple DSL makes telling robots what to do incredibly simple and fun.

  All you need to get started is the `artoo` gem

      :::ruby
      require 'artoo'

   Then hook it up to your robot (in this case, a [Sphero](http://gosphero.com)):

      :::ruby
      connection :sphero, adaptor: :sphero, port: '4560'
      device :sphero, driver: :sphero

  And tell it what to do!

      :::ruby
      work do
        every(3.seconds) do
          puts "Rolling..."
          sphero.roll 60, rand(360)
        end
      end
